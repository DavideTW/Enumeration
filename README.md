# Enumeration

Enumeration is a Java Abstraction for enumeration problems, based on backtracking.

It defines an abstract class `Enumeration<T>` that has a generic type `T` that represent the type of the data.

There are two examples of implementation:
1. **SubsetsEnumeration**: List all subsets of the set {1, ..., n} 
2. **PermutationEnumeration**: Print all permutations of a set A.
